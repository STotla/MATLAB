# MATLAB
it is matlab code for finding the solutions of linear equations having n variable
with the help of Gauss-Seidel method which is a iterative process
and converges to the actual value with increase in no. of iteration,
the first and foremost thing before applying G-S method is to transform our coefficient variable in dominant diagonal matrix ,
if this step was skipped ,the solution never converges, 
it starts going far away from actual values. so after converting to dominant matrix then Gauss seidel theorem is applied with certain no. iteration. 
iterative process keep going till error in solution became less than the tolerance limit.
